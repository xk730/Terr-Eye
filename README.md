# Terr-Eye
A device that helps automatically install, launch, and update servers for the game "Terraria"  
一款可帮助自动安装、启动和更新游戏“泰拉瑞亚（Terraria）”服务器的装置  

注意※：这是我突发奇想制作的系统，他依靠泰拉瑞亚（Terraria）官方的api运行，由于最近比较忙，目前仅仅上传了适配Linux系统的部分并且不保证任何需求一定被解决，本项目目前处于未正式发布阶段。  
Note ※: This system was created on a whim and relies on the official API of Terraria. Due to recent busy schedules, only the part compatible with the Linux system has been uploaded, and there is no guarantee that all requirements will be met. This project is currently in the unreleased stage.
